The process of data collection is handled autonomously since we are using an SQL database backend that is already
populated with required data. That required data being product information such as: product name, product code, 
quantity of product in stock, and the price of each unit of product.This required data is used to calculate cost of a transaction
and enables the cart feature of our program to be useful.
